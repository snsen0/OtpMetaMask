# Otp and Metamask Project

This project enables users to log in using their phone numbers and includes an identity verification system. Users can enter their names, surnames, and phone numbers, and then receive a **One-Time Password (OTP)** verification code through a service like Firebase. This code is sent to the user's phone number and initiates the identity verification process.

Additionally, the project provides users with the ability to access their **MetaMask wallets**. MetaMask is a popular wallet provider that allows secure access to Ethereum-based applications. Users can connect to their Ethereum wallets using MetaMask and thus verify their identity.

This project offers OTP delivery through services like Firebase and the option to connect to MetaMask wallets. Users can complete a secure identity verification process using their phone numbers and MetaMask wallets, making it especially useful for secure login in Ethereum-based applications.
